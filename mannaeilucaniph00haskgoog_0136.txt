AUGUSTAN WRITERS cxxvii

lssHorace, the relation between the writers is not worth pursuing

n length. lt is chiefly in stray phrases and allusions that the

resemblance is detected. The influence of Horace on the Phar-

Α soleii generally is not observable.
’ Ιο Ovid Lucan seems to stand in a closer relation. Not
only do numberless mythological details seem to come from
lle Metamorphoses ; but (as 1 have remarked above ξ 49 b, c)
beis in some important characteristics of his rhythm a sollower
of Ovid. Great though the difference is between the two, it
sin Ovid that we begin to trace the growth of the smooth
remification which is so unfavourable to the effect of the Plar-
ulia. ln the detailed elaboration of detached episodes we again
ee a tendency beginning in Ovid and completely established in
„ucan How it grew up Ι have pointed out above (ξ 27).

That Lucan used Livy as an authority is very probable, if
rot certain, and l wish 1 had been able to see G Baier’s dis·
ertation on this subject. The main items of evidence seem to
ie these. The name of Crastinus in vl1471 is said to come
rom Livy. The story of the augur Cornelius vl1 192—200 is
eported by Plutarch as told by Livy. The affair of the envoy
(4684-74 is said by a scholiast to be told by Livy but rather
lifferently. The affair of Ganymedes Arsinoe and Achillas
k 519—23 is apparently taken from Livy, according to the same
scholiast. Livy (fragm 45 Weissenborn) seems, according to
lemme, to have eulogized Cato. He was used as an authority
by Seneca (fragm 41 and 48). In the Periochae of books clx-
cxn are mentioned a number of incidents which reappear in
Lucan with wonderful correspondence of detail so far as these
neagre abstracts enable one to judge. Lastly from Tacitus ann
lv 34 we leam that Livy greatly eulogized Pompey, so that
Augustus called him a Pompeian.

Itis worth while to note a few parallels which may prove
llat Lucan had read and was at a given moment bearing in
mind passages from Augustan poets now only known by a line
>rtwo, Ι repeat that 1 do not press these small resemblances;
he point is in no way material to my argument. But it is
etter to submit the few lines in question to the examination of
thers from this point of view.
