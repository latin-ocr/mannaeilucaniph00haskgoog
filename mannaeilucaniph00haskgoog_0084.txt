fbessaly; and we could well spate both. After this we have
ln account¹¹ of Thessalian witches in 72 lines. Then the witch
>f the bour takes up 63 lines” of unspeakable foulness and
norror: and Sextus' interview¹³ with her runs to 260 lines
more. This horrid scene despite its ghastliness is not without
acertain dignity of its own: and the last 3 lines are appropriate
and good. The story²⁴ of Cato's march along the north of
Africa gives an opportunity, not to be missod, of bringing in
the real and fabled plagues of Africa: which run into the
legend of Medusa and her death at the hands of Perseus.
This passage, about 80 lines long, is followedby 34 lines'⁶
ofa list of the local snakes. Then comes*u a list, with names
and particulars, of men bitten by various snakes and hence
dying various appropriate deaths: this takes more than 100
lines. Caesar feasts with Cleopatra, and we accordingly are
treatedto 25 lines²² detailing the luxurious appliances of the
Egyptian queen. Nor is it only in the narrative that these
passages occur: the speeches are similarly weighted. ¹The
burden is ‘any war but a civil war ’‚ and we have 8 lines*⁸
out of 18 given to a needless catalogue of possible enemies.
Aspeaker descantslo on the atrocities of the civil war of
Marius and Sulla; but surely it is too much to give 120
lines of his speech to mere butchery, with names and par-
ticulars in the cases of the chief victims. Surely we might
read of Curio’s landing in Africa without 60 lines⁸⁰ devoted
to the utterly irrelevant story of Hercules and Antaeus. When
Caesar in a great hurry is wanting to put to sea at once, and
chafing at delay, it is ludicrous for the fisherman to entertain
him with 161ines⁸¹ recounting the signs of bad weather to come.

(c) The occurrence of passages, sometimes of great length,
in which the author moralizes as a political historian or discusses

natural phenomena‚ strikes every reader of the Pharsalia. These
