xxviii JEALOUSY. LUCAN IN DISGRACE

The occasions of offence were such as the peculiar circumstances Ἴ
ol the two were sooner or later certain to create.

(10) Literary rivalry and jealousy as between ruler and
subject can hardly be serious unless the subject is the better
Α man and knows ie Then the ruler must call in his power to
make up sor the shortcoming of his genius, and this must be
resented by the subject. Such were soon the relative positions
ol Nero and Lucan. Even the servile audiences os the time
must now and then betray their preference sor the gifted young
Spaniard. They remembered' how Augustus had patronized
men os letters; and indeed the traditional policy²² oi the Empire
had been to leave literature sree. Claudius may have been a
literary pedant; but at any rate he was an easy-going one.
lt could hardly be soreseen how dangerous it would prove to
dispute the palm os poetic genius with Nero. At last the two
met as rivals in a great public contest, and the prize was
adjudgcd” to Lucan. This Nero could not endure: he began
to slight Lucan’‘ by various acts of discourtesy: Lucan replied
by ill-concealed or open ridicule, and by straining himsell'⁵ to
shew off the fertility and variety ol his taient. Then Nero
directly interposed by forbidding him¹⁰ to publish poems or recite
them. Such are the outlines of the traditional story, which 1
can see no good reason sor doubting.

(ΩΟ) The prohibition was no doubt secretly resented by
many: we can laintly imagine the wounded vanity and bitter
rage os Lucan himself. ln an enforced retirement-probably in
the stately gardens¹“ spoken os by Juvenal—he brooded over
his wrongs. Unless Nero should relent,—a most unlikely con·
tingency,-he knew that the career ior which he had prepared
