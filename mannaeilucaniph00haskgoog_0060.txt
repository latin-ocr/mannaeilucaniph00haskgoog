FORTUNA AND FA TUM li

(c) As lor Lucan's own religious beliefs, we can say little more
hen that throughout the poem ¹⁹ the ruling divinity is the capricious
bstraction Fortuna. She is not so much a positive divinity asa
ugatire substitute ior one. Is l may venture to put lorward a rather
told view, it seems to me that the wavering philosophy oi Lucan is
eflected in his dual religion, meaning by religion his theory of the
premment ol the world. To me it seems that his satum and Ihrtuna
ne as Stoic and Epicurean: satum is impersonal‚ but presupposes gods,
Murra is persouified only to dispense with them. Therefore it is
murat enough that in the Pharsalia it is seldom or never possible to
draw any practical distinction between Fortuna and satam .· they are two
teuent views oi the same thing.

lt was natural to personiiy Fortuna: she had been from ancient
limes a goddess widely worshipped in Italy, and it was only when
tlte old belieis began to pass away that she came to be regarded

amere conventional abstraction. See Preller Rbm Myth 11 pp 178

(d) To Lucan the creeds and ceremonies ol men are merely details,
lislnowledge oi which he is proud to display. And to the Spanish
provincial the old Italian worships were no more or little more than
bose oi Syria or Egypt. To Vergil there was clearly a peculiar glamour
about the national religion os Italy, and his mind was oi a tender
tererent cast. ln no respect do the two writers differ more than in
lbeir relations to the religions ol their respective ages.

(36) Relation to Leaming and History.

That learning was one os the most valued qualities in a
¹lionran poet, and that to call him dactus was one of the highest
{eompliments is become a commonplace of literary history.
3‘lo this observation Lucan forms no exception. For a youth
'sito died at the ageos 26 years his display oi learning*⁰ is
ipodigious. The Pharsalia teems with historical astronomical
geographica} and technical details; the similes and epithets
rek os them, and everywhere we meet allusions more or less
incondite drawn from the vast stores os myth and legend. Like
