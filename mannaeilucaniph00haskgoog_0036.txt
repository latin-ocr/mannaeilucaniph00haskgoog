LUCAN IN FA VOUR xxvii

ment, is not all that could be wished, was at least tolerable:
and with the mob os Rome the young prinee was popular. But
alter the murder os his mother Agrippina he seemed to throw
off all restraint. Among the many enormities by which he
earned the hatred and loathing ol Roman society none more
impressed¹⁸ his contemporaries than the vanity, combined with

lack of dignity, which led him to exhibit himself in public on the
stage and arena. He loved to appear as the first ol harpers and
chariotdrivers3 and the harpers and chariot·drivers bowed to the
necessity ol submitting to the claims os one who could and would
enforce them. He loved also to write verses and recite them to
applauding audiences; and here he became the rival ol Lucan.
(18) Lucan, the pet os the first literary circle in Rome,
had probably attracted the notice¹⁹ ol the young emperor soon
after he came to the throne. But Ι see no means ol de·
termining the exact date ol the honours he conlerred on
Lucan, the quaestorship and the augural priesthood. The
quaestorship and entry into the senate²⁰ regularly went to·
gether, and the legal minimum age was 25 years. This would
bring Lucan’s quaestorship to AD 64, which is too late ; and
besides we are told that he was not os the required age.
1 think that it was probably soon alter the lestival²¹ Neronia,
first held in 603 on which occasion Lucan made his first appear-
ance before the general public os Rome and recited a panegyric
on Nero. Therelore l incline to place it in 61, and I find that
Genthe had already arrived at the same conclusion. Be this as
it may, it seems clear that sor some time aster the year 60 no
open rupture took place. Indeed we should rather infer that
the relations between Lucan and the emperor were os as friendly
a character as circumstances would permit. But slowly and
surely rivalry was leading to jealousy and jealousy to hatred.
