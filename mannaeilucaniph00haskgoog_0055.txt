xlvi THE SOUL AND WILL

This Stoic doctrine probably made it more easy sor Lucan ¹to fall in with thc
habit, very common in ancient times, 01 recognizing a body and soul as two separate
things and then coniusing them together. This confusion as it appears in the Phar·
salia is indeed particularly harsh.

In vt 719-—231he umbra and cadaver are present separately at the same time.
The body is called the carcer 01 the umbra. The witch compeis the soul unwillingly
to reenter the body, and aiter its message has been delivered she in Bar reverse: the
process and helps the sates animum sibi reddere. In v111 759 1011 Cordus begs
Pompey ruanis animamque potentem official ovate meis, and it seems that tlre identity
01 the dead man is bound up specially with his body. And the words maner umbra
anima seem distinct from cor‘pus cadaver cineres in such passages as vn 770, 776,
vrrr 432, ⁸60‚[a11norab1e1ines], tx r soll, x 33⁶· The soul is however conceived ot'
as material throughout. In 1x640-r Medusa is described as congertling the anima
or umbra in the human irame. ln vt 621-3, we read that the umbra osa man
newly slain can speak more clearly than that 01 one tvho has been sometime dead.
This well illustratas the extension 01 the soul throughout the body. In vlu 43²-5
Crassus’ umbra is supposed to tell Pompey that it has long hoped ior his coming
to avenge the cineres osa nuda umbra, that is, the ashes to which the umbra belongs.
In a number 01 passages amnes and umbro are really in sense equal to corpus. Set

And in vu 775 cadavera perform the ghostly iunction 01 oratus.

These instances 01 Lucan’s usage 1 think it worth while to give here. Fora
poet to distinguish clearly between a soul and a body both material was not easy.
Vergil felt the difficulty ; see Conington on georgics 1v4y5. And Ovid speaking 01
the Feralia says in fasti 11565-o nunc animae tenues et corporo functa sepulchris
errant ; nunc portio pascitur untbra cibo. Is any one will read Lucian περὶ πένθους
he will see the confusion 01 notions¹⁶ well illustrated. The curious will see that it is
very old by turning to Odysscy xr 602 [see Ameis' note on 1 aoy. He points out
that identity is in the Homeric poerns determined by the body]. See the Drnid view
as stated by Lucan 1 454-7.

For the connexion between the soul 01 man and the great God see tx 573 1011.
Compare Manilius 11 105 1011.

The souls 01 the great and good find a place among the stars 01 heaven, as
Pompey in rx 1 soll, with which compare Manilius 1 754-7 an lortes animae
dignataque nomina caelo corporibus resoluta suis terraeque remissa huc migrant
ex orbe suumque habitantia caelum aetherios vivunt annos mundoque fruuntur? and
the list 01 heroes 758 1011.

Thongh all things are bound by the chain 01 necessity, still in a
certain sense the will 01 man is free ; hence there is moral responsibility.
Our actions are the productos universal law and individual character
combined. Zellervrr 1³3·

Lucan clearly recognizes moral responsibility in spite 01 destiny. Thongh sate
decrees victory to Caesar, his overthrow 01 the Senatorial oligarchy is none the less
criminal; though Pompey is doomed to die byn treacherous murder, this does not
