USE OF CASES ciii

vires maturae mortes labae? 935 extractam martem ex-
spuit.
To these we may add pugnus, pondus, robur, populi, saecula,
lc.

We see this tendency beginning in Propertius, but he seems
ingular among his contemporaries. With Lucan we find it
stablished in Roman literature.

(b) Use of cases.

*The socalled ‘accusative ol respect' is much rarer in Lucan
han in Vergil. There are however a good many instances such
s 11 335-6, v 170-1, 518, v1 625, 658, v11 586, v111240, 752,
x 171-2, 842-3, x 83, 84, 134, 137, 309.

A lew instances ot' the genitive after adjectives and participles
nay be worth noting, though they are for the—most part not
nnovations: such as 11 578 metuens pelagi, 1111 373 donnini
netuentem, V111 811 pavidos mare's, VI 106 liber terrae, 301 libera

lgm vll 118 libera fortunae, 240 aeger morae,1x 373 annorum
ideas.

Genitive singular aster neuter singular ol adjective substan-
ivally used.

11 128-9 parvom sanguineo, v 467 minimum terrae, x 2 5 3
tacitum mundi.

The dative, especially the s0·called dativus commodi and its
ribe, is used buldly and sometimes harshly. Examples are '
necessary.

11 547 ut Catulo iacuit Lepidus [compare Gratius 315 sicet
Achaemenio creaturi, Lydia, Cyro, Cornel Severus fr 13
l 24 nostraeque cadens ferus Hannibal irae], V 343 len-
manum parteis vivit genus, v11 451-2 astra Thyestae
impulit, 1x 259 quod tibi non ducibus aierit morerisque,
x 115 stabatque sibi aon segnis aeliotes (cl v11 697 etc).

In 11 126 neglectum violatae dextrae the dative is harsh: the
unstruction looks differently when the person and not a limb
>s him is mentioned, as x 177 nen neglecte deis.
