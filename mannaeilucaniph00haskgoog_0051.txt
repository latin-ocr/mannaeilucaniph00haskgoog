l think not, and for two reasons. If there is one thing in
which he does believe, it is Fate: and Fate had declar ²¹ sor
a monarchy. Moreover‚ crude though Lucan's political notions
were, he does shew traces of having learnt that without a manly
seli-respecting aristocracy and a patriotic commonalty no Re-
public was possible. Such at least is the inference l draw stom
his references¹² to the servile Senate and mongrel plebs os the
Imperial days. He had caught the tone os the Stoic circle iu
which he moved. He acquiesces in the ordinance os Fate. But
Fate might soon ordain a further change. Lucan had also
caught the tone of the reactiouary senatorial eliques. This
tone is still prevailing in Tacitus so great was its vitality.
The young provincial, writing as a Roman ol the Romans,
ialls into this tone naturally enough, and probably he is carried
away by the flow os declamation and says -far more than he
seriously means. Os course he had no real¹⁸ knowledge os the
Roman Republic, and whatever genuine hatred os the Empire
had grown up in him from personal experience was probably
no more than a youth's impatient desire sor greater oppor-
tunities of shining in a literary career.

My conclusions therefore are very nearly the same as those
at which Dean Merivale¹⁴ arrived years ago, 1 am glad to find
that this is the case: so much the better ior me. But 1 cannot
agree with him in thinking that Lucan did not ‘regard the
principate as a tyranny ἐ the evidence to the contrary, the more
1 examine it, seems only the more overwhelming.
