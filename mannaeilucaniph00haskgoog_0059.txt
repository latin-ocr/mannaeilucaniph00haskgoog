l REFERENCES ΤΟ RELIGIONS

But it was impossible to suppress the Eastem worships, which bad Ι
taken so snm a hold of the popular imagination. The tmth is that
for the time they met to some extent a want with which no philosophy
could deal. And under the influence of Oriental ideas the Roman
Ἴ religion underwent a most important modification in the introduction d
the worship of deceased emperors.

Still there was one thing wanting. lf there 'was one power in which
Romans generally did believe, it was the ‘Manifest Destiny' of Rome.
Accordingly there was growing up the worship of the great godden
Roma, the personified might fortune and glory of the mistress of the Ι
ancient world.

Such are the features that especially draw our attention in reviewing ζ
the state of religion at Rome in the age of Nero. But amid all thir ἶ
the ancient worships went on undisturbed. And to some of them,
traditionally derived frorn Troy, a greater importance than ever wat
now for family reasons attached by the emperors of the Julian line “

following references in Lucan.

Roma as a goddess calls fora few remarks. There was not so far as 1 can discover
any temple dedicated to her in Rome till the temple of Venus and Roma buin
by Hadrian. The worship began among the Asiatic Greeks in the days of the
Republic, and it appeared in many provincial towns as time went ou. The
goddess is represented on coins, like other tutelary goddesses, es wearing a murel
crown. Hence Lucan speaking of patriae imago appearing to Caesar says 1 188
turrigero cattos ffurdcnr rrrrtr'ce crines. He attributes to her a divine cuncter

her in other places as vlt 373 atque ipsam dontine' metuentem occurren Roman,
vt11 3²² Roma. fave coeptas. Less striking instances 1 omit: but 1 conceive that
1 have shewn ground for believing that Romo was in Lucan’s time reeogniaed
as a divinity‚ though her formal worship had notas yet been established in
the city itself. For details concerning dea Roma see Preller's Riimische Mythologie
