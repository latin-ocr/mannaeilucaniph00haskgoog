rantnrque Imbecissc parem, 770-1 nullo dubii discrimine
Martis ancipites steterunt casus, vt 134 nimbusque ferens
tat tela peribat, 297 caeci trepidus sub nnbe timoris [cf 625,
vll 530—1], VH 811 finemque sni sibi corpora debent, vl11
25 actaque lauriferae damnat Sullana inuentae, lx 22 5-6
unns aperta mente fugae.

These shew license pushed toan excess sometimes grotesque
hthe extreme, and very characteristic of the literature of this
period. Rhetoricians competing in audacity had irreparably in-
iured the language. In the crabbed phrases of Persius and the
tlovenly style of the elder Pliny we see the natural result.

(e) Into what shapes of obscurity dark' and involved
Lucan could torture the clearest of languages may be seen by
referring to the following passages:

1 86, 98,111 23, 328-9, 410-1, 1v 243—5, v 278—82‚ 473
—4‚ vr 482, vn 1-3, 436-9, 504-5,1x 398-402.

The following references will illustrate the bold or careless
way in which Lucan sometimes arranges the words in a sen-
tence. The same sort of thing occurs in the older writers [see
Vergil Aen v11 305-6, XII 64—5, etc] but hardly I think to the
same extent as in Lucan.

1 14, 111 679, v 321, 387, 680, 691-2, vr 710—1, vn 685
-6, rx 193—n, 232-3.

(f) Relative clauses are thrust in very clumsily, breaking
the flow of the sentence, and giving a prosaic effect, as for
instance 1 14 hecquem ciuiles ltanseruut sangnine dextrae, ΙΙΙ 14
—5 tenentis Eumenidas quaterent quas vestris lampadas arinis,
v520—1 molli cartsnrgit Amyclas, qnam dabat alga toro. And
iu general we find the relative used in Lucan very freely, as in
prose writers awkward though it is in verse.

Parentheses are sometimes long and clumsy, stopping the
flow of a sentence altogether, as lx 305—11, or they break an
antithesis, as x 383.

(g) The subject of the verb is sometimes awkwardly
changed as 1v 34—5, v 371-2,1x 37-8.

Sometimes the object of the verb is omitted, as 11 279, 728,
tv 353, v 298, and it is sometimes far from easy to supply it.
