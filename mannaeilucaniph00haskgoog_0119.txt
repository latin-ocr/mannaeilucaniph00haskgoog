cx RELAYION TO VERGIL

That it requires caresul and continuous reading to ap
the influence oi Vergil on Lucan, Ι readily admit Th
enee os manner in the two writers is enonnous. Verg
lover os the country, gentle, sympathetic, quiet, conter
master os his learning, caresul in selection, weaves tog<
story unobserved and sets his imaginations in subtle hz
of rhythm and style. Lucan, a young city prodigy
declamatory, eager to display all his undigested erudi*
make telling hits to catch the applause of an audience,
transitions and without sense of proportion, poor in ima
-how should he give us general effects other than
rhetoric? His is the hurried result os effort, Vergil’s
fruit os loving labour.

If this be s0, why does not the influence oi Vergil o
strike the eye at once? Because Lucan aster all is n‹

he is strong, and when he borrows he altem, sometimes
in wanton¹ rivalry. Resides, many os the parallels dos
eye even at a cursory glance.

¹ This rivalry is traced by Nisard in many confidentes having the clue to l
passages, indeed he makes it one oi the main lt is to be remembered that it talc
influentes at work in Lucan. lcannot go quite to borrow judiciously and that t
so lar aa he does, and think it wiser not to be so velopcs greatly with age.
