MEMORY PRESER VED. CONCLUDING REMARKS xxxi

a great celebrity. Yet its title to the name ola poem was
questioned. But the striking vigour ol its best passages, the
Roman patriotism it breathes‚ the greatness ol its theme, the
untimely death ol its author and the remembrance ol his early
popularity,—these and other influences combined were sufficient
not to let it die It was lreely criticised lrom the first, as we
see lrom the words ol Petronius Quintilian Martial Fronto and
the Life by Vacca. Tacitus speaks ol it with respect asa
classical work, and it was used as an historical authority by
Florus and Appian. There are many traces in the later poets
ol a more or less conscious imitation ol his lines. In Martial
and Statius we find passages directly bearing on his memory
and his writings. These two seem to have been intimate friends
ol his widow⁸⁸ Polla Argentaria, and to have kept up an ob-
servance of his birthday. Statius' poem addresscd to Polla,
known as genethliacon Lucani, is indeed one ol our chiel sources
ol information in regard to Lucan’s lile and works.

(24) In this sketch of Lucan's lile 1 have confined mysell
to matters on the knowledge of which as it seems to me an
intelligent criticism ol the Pharsalia must primarily rest. Itis
no part ol my plan to speak ol the 75 or 80 manuscripts³² (which
l have never seen) or describe the numerous printed editions
lrom 1469 to the present day. Nor do Ι propose to collect the
references allusions and reminiscences in the Mediaeval writers
and in most ol the great authors since the Revival ol Learning,
interesting on general grounds though such memorials might be.
Suffice it here to say that from Tacitus and Fronto to Macaulay⁸⁸
Lucan has never lacked admirers and critics. One lact is ol
special significance to an Englishman,-the interest taken in the
Pharsalia in England during great part ol the 17th century.
The historian ol the Long Parliament, Thomas May, wrote a
continuation⁸⁹ ol Lucan's work in Latin verse to the death ol
Caesar. He also translated the whole into English heroic cou-
plets. 1 would add that it is a pity we have no good English
