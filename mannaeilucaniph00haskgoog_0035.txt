in a youth at least this was wellnigh impossible: and young
Lucan, puffed up with presumed merits and the applause of the
lecture-room, became a shallow rhetorician ‘intoxicated with
the exuberance' os his own fatal fluency, ready to write and
declaim on any subject in verse or prose at the shortest
notice.

Roman audiences could conser he had more than enough. 1f
we are to believe what we are told os his fertility¹⁴, it was simply >
portentous. A poem on the story os Orpheus, another on the
sate ol Troy, another on the nether world ; plays os various
kinds; lighter works, such as epigrams3 prose declamations ol
the type common in the schools os rhetoric, an account os the
great lire os Rome, a collection os letters :—such were the
productions¹⁶ ol the boyish pen os this youth born in 39 AD
and destined to die in 65. And these in addition to his chief
work the Pharsalia, the first three books ol which are said to
have been written early in his briel career. Whether he prac-
tised¹⁶ as a pleader in the courts must remain doubtful, but it is
at least probable that he did so. Many ol these works may well
have been not inferior in merit to much that has come down to
us srom the writers ol imperial Rome; but the loss os the early
crudities of the author os the Pharsalia will hardly move a keen
regret.

(17) The upper classes in Rome, actual or prospective
victims os tyranny, looked back on the rule os Tiberius and
Gaius with horror: even a reign marked by prosperity and
conquest had lest Claudius an object os scoffing and contempt.
