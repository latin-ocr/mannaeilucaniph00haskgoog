BOOKS OF THE PHARSALIA xxxiii

expedition oi Curio. This is an average book; the apostrophe at the end is·
famous

Only 591-‹560 (story os Antaeus) can be strictly called padding.

v. This book is mainly concemed with the concentration in Epirus.
The senate appears in dignity 3ηά power; Pompey is hardly heard ol till
the end, when his parting with Cornelia is well described. Caesar’s figure
dominates the book, at one time quelling a mutiny, at another facing his
rival with only a part os his forceS, at another putting to sea in a small boat
and deiying the storm. The book is an important one, 3ηά in spite os
the absurd description of the storm l think it rather above the average in
merit.

The padding is 65-236 [Appius 3ηά the Delphic oracle].

vt. The movements about Dyrrhachium, including the overdrawn epi-
sode of Scaeva, make up all the action of this book. Half of it is devoted
to the affair os the witch, which, though irrelevant, is better than the first
hals. The book is a poor one, and the least essential nithe ten.

Padding 333—412 (Thessaly), 438-569 (witches).

vti. The two main themes os the seventh book are (a) the different
feelings oi the leaders and their armies at the approach ol battle, (b) the
great battle 3ηά its result. lt contains a great deal beside this; eg the fine
lines 185-213 on the sorebodings oi the battle, 387—459 3ηά 632-46
reflexions on the greatne'ss ol the disaster, complaints oi slavery, indignation

at the gods, etc, 847-72 apostrophe to Thessaly,-all famous passages.
ln spite os much declamation os a wild sort, irrational remarks, and serious
inaccuracy, this is clearly the great book os the Pharsalia Lucan is elevated
by his subject, and it isin this book that the interest culminates and the
decision oi fate is made known.

Padding is not a suitable word to apply to the digressions ol this book.

v111. This book contains little οῖ’ action, nothing indeed but the ssight
and death ol Pompey. Caesar disappears sor the present. We here pass
from the decision os sate to its consummation, and at the close os the book
the main action ol the poem is ended. The extraneous matter is plentisul
in this book, and some might deserve the name oi padding; l mean eg
541-60 [reflexions on Egypt and apostrophe to Ptolemy], 692-711 [re-
flexions on Pompey's death], 793-822 [D0 on his burial], 823—72 [apo-
strophe to Egypt} Such passages seem much more laboured here than when
thrown ort in the excitement oi the death-struggle as in book vlt. Much ol
tlte book is very irrational and wild. Still it has a distinct interest as con·

taining the catastrophe, and some passages [eg 806-22] are really fine.

lx. This book is what Greek editors might have called Κάτωνος ἀριστεῖα.
Cato is the hero os the book: he is especially great in the desert and at the
oracle os Hammon. At the end Caesar reappears, hastening on Pompey's
track The book has in it some fine passages, such as 544—86 [Cato at
