CARDINES xciii

(δ) (Though there are trees in the oasis) ‘even then there
is nothing to keep off the sun when the day stands
poised on the top ol the meridian',-that is, when the
sun is at the zenith, he is right over the oasis, and there
is thus no shade.

(γ) ‘Parnasus which rises alost in two pcaks, is equidistant
from the meridians of East and West'‚-that is, it is
exactly under the upper meridian; or, in modern phrase,
the meridian of Delphi is the prime meridian. Surely
I need hardly remind the reader that Delphi was called
the earth's navel.

(β) ‘Where his realm is at its longest, it is bounded, towards
the meridiari of the West by Atlas, towards the middle
by Hammon’s oasis’,-that is, instead os defining it by
West and East, he does so by West and the middle: for
Numidia lay wholly to the West os the Delphic or
middle meridian.

(a) ‘Here where the ocean is reached [iam] held in by the

bounds of the West wind and the furthest meridian os
Olympus, (the clouds), being forbidden to cross the
water, were congested into dense balls (of molsture)'.
Olympus is the Heaven of the upper hemisphere, op-
posed to Tartams: the West meridian is the furthest
[so is the East] because beyond it is the lower hemi-
sphere.

That Lucan clearly and fully thought out the meaning ol
these expressions 1 do not maintain: but 1 do maintain
t such is the strict meaning and that we need not wonder
tis lightly employing as a matter of course the language os
ic astrology.
Ι now return to Manilius, who presently goes on to speak
he astrological importance ot' the cardines. Of the Western
‚ays [11 833-7]:

ultimus, emenso qui condit sidera mundo,

occasumque tenens submersum despicit orbem,

pertinet adrerum summas finemque laborum

coniugia atque epulas extremaque tempora vitae
otiaque et coetus hominum cultusque deorum.
