t Virtue is rational activity conformable to Nature, that is, to the ’
sal law os the world and the essential constitution oi the being,
in the case of man is reason. It is rational sels-control. Zeller

Stoic idea oi virtue is oi course expressed in the character of Cato 11 380
istray ronches here and there. Brutus [ι] 239f011] admires his serenity, but
rs into the war not undet any delusion as to Pompey's ambition [11 319rolll
er Pompey's death he takes the lead, calm unbiassed undeceived as ever
foll, 188 [011]- He is unswayed by emotions, the personification oi virtus

·us kind [rx 298—9]· He knows no sear [lx 371-3]‚ and ireely expresses his
ige oi danger and readiness to iace it [rx 379 foll]. He sets the example os
egation [rx 500 tou, 587 loll], and seli-devotion [rx 60410111. He is conscious

»od and Bad are absolute notions, admitting no degrees. So the
us Good or Wise man is absolutely good 3 the Vicious Bad or

true illustration in Lucan oi the absence ol degrees oi Good and Bad is to
din the characters oi Caesar Pompey and Cato. Lucan must have admired
to judge by the portrait he has drawn oi him ; but not only was he the
ower of the Senate, he was known to lean towards the school oi Epicurus.
›re he can do nothing right, and the ceaseless malignity with which Lucan
es to him the worst os motives seems to us pitiful and childish. As t'or
v, the attempt to make him into a hero actuated only by the very highest
. is perhaps the greatest historical blunder of the Pharsalus. Cato is specially
ing. because into his mouth are put the lines tx 569 toll an noceat vis ulla
fortunaque perdat opposita virtute minas, laudandaque velle sit satis et nurn-
ucceesu crescat honestum? scimus, et haec nobis non altius inseret Hammon.

ι As the tendency to independence‚ to live ior oneself alone, to
rse with society and cultivate the inner freedom of virtuous life,
up to the condition oi the sels-sufficing Wise Man3 so the ten·
to follow the social instinct and live ior the common good, to
society and cultivate the social virtueS, leads up to the condition
Citizen ol the World. Zeller xri u 1, xiv Α 1.
