treat of his relations to Nero aud generally to the imperial
govemment

Ιιι the opening¹ of the poem we meet with the famous
passage in which he oourts the fatmr of Nero by the most
grovelling flattery. All the horrors of the ciml nats may be
regarded with mlmness or even satisfaction if they were merely
the antecedent conditions of the aduent of Nero Nero isin
fact a god, and this address fills the place of the invocations
customary in epic poems libat Apollo or Bacchus were to the
singers of old‚ that is Nero, the centre of Roman hopes, to
Lucan.

the next topic in which we may l think certainly see a
reference to Nero is the favourable² handling of the character
of L Domitius Ahenobarbus, Nero belonged by birth to the
Domitian house, and we know' that the connexion was not for·

’ gotten. 'ibis Domitius, greatgreatgrandfather of the emperor,

is mentioned in connexion with the affair of Corfinium as
commanding the Pompeian right wing at Pharsalia; as defying
with his latest breath⁴ Caesar who had before given him his
freedom and his life He is indeed the most fierce aud im·
placable foe of the Caesarian cause

Several other passages have been supposed to bear a more
or less direct reference to Nero. Such are the following. The
description of the amburbium and other ritas is taken to be
drawn from the ceremony of purification performed⁸ by Nero in
Αι) 56, at which Lucan would naturally be present This in·
ference seems to me probable enough. lt has been thought⁰
that in the passage where he expresses the Roman abhorrence
of the incestuous laxity of Orientals Lucan may have had in
his mind the scandalous stories about Nero and his mother
Agrippina. This conjecture does not satisfy me At least, if I

accepted this, I should find no, difficulty in beliering that when
he speaks' of the Furies pursuing the mother-slayer Orestes
