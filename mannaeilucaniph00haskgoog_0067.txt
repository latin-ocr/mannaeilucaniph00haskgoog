should consider an unmanly tone. She replies in a much higher strain, aad

using the claim of old services to stir up the Parthian king. This is Pompey

rebuked by lentulus in a speech too long by half but good in spirit. He
advises a retreat to Egypt, and to Egypt they go. Then comes the treachery

Such is the character, drawn by Lucan himself, of the man
on whom he lavishes³ his warmest admiration and praise. The
picture has at least one merit, it explains Pompey's fall, for it
is far more true to the original than Lucan's comments would
lead us to expect-one may almost say, than Lucan meant it to
be,

Its main defects are jealousy vanity and slowness. Pompey
is too jealous to be ocul-headed, too vain⁴ to be clear-headed,
too slow to seire opportunities He cannot bear a rival, he
cannot recognize a superior, he cannot justify a'ction by vigour
or ambition by daring. His shallow nature cannot work up to a
firm decision based on a clear cool judgment of present facts, and
then carry out that decision at all costs with the energy of con·
viction. He is never really convinced himself, and he may be
said to aim at persuading others rather than convincing them.
His patriotism is at the bottom but vanity and selfishness. Such
a man was perhaps fitted to be the leader of an effete aristocracy:
his technieal skill sufficed for ordinary warfare. But civil war
demands a moral force that is bomin a man, and is not to be
