xc METAPHORS

Nisard 11251 well points out that in 11 244-5 we have '
good instance of false metaphor: for labantem dirige, dubie ’
firma, should strictly be labentem firma, dubium dirige.

Metaphors were already becoming conventional in Lucan'
time. Such words as mergere, stimuli, imputare, momentus!
premere, are worked to death by the writers os the Silver Age
I go on to give references shewing the departments from whid}
some of Lucan's chief metaphors are drawn.

[Digresslon] In several passages Lucan speaks oi the car·
dines, using them to determine the geographical position oi some
place or phenomenon; and in one line he employs cardo in so
bold a phrase that it seems well to devote a short digression to
this special point. 1 do not possess the knowledge required for
an exhaustive treatment os the subject, but I think I may do
something towards making clear one notable meaning os cardo
and proving that the isolated bold use os which I have spoken
is merely a trace os Stoic astrology. “

Leaving aside 1 5 52-3 cardine tellus subsedit, where cardo·

has the common sense of ‘axis’, the following are the passages
in Lucan:

(a) lv 72-4 [of the congestion of rain-clouds over Spain]

hic, ubi iam Zephyri fines et summus¹ Olympi
cardo tenet Tethyn, vetitae transcurrere densos
involvere globos
