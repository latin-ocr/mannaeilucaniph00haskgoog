NERO AND THE EMPJRE xxxix

he is really thinking of the similar story about the mother·
alayer Nero. While reading in the spirit of allusion-hunting I
¹nuce fancied that the description⁶ of the νεκυομαντεία in the
'lixth book was inspired by Nero's failure in a like enterprise:

tit seems that the attempt of Nero was after Lucan’s death.
'lhe notion would then be absurd, and the introduction of such
passage simply explained by its being drawn from a common·
cebook. Whether the same may not be the case with the
es about incest and matricide I must leave some one
ecompetent or confident to decide.

Ι Much greater importance attaches to the question whether
the digression in the ninth b00k⁹ on the site of Troy is in any
yconnected with Nero's appearance as patron of the Ilians
rtly before the death of Claudius. If it be so connected,

it not only renders the above-mentioned doubtful allusions Ι ’

ite improbable, because a return to complaisance after such
' eous insinuations is hardly to be conceived‚—but it will also
wlour our views as to the full significance of some passages*
nich we shall presently discuss. lf it be not—and such is my
heided opinion, for the Ilian origin of the Julian house was
lwised before the Aeneid, and the matter would readily suggest
ΜΡ to a writer fond of digressive description and steeped in
legit-then nothing is affected by it, and we proceed un-
hmpered on our way.

1 pass on to the consideration of passages where the refer-
hroe is not to Nero but to the Empire of the Caesars. These

ines must be quoted in full.
