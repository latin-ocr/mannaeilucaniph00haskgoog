I now proceed to Pompey's words in Lucan book VII.

(ε) ‘I pray yon keep from me that worst ol lates, degrada-
tion in my declining years'‚-that is, in the years ol
my last meridiam the fourth or Westem meridian ol
Manilius. It is an astrological notion that reminds us
of, but is not the same ae, our metaphor os ‘life’s
sunset'.

That the meaning of cardo in the language of the gromatic
“ writers is closely connected with that discussed above is easy to
shew‚ but I do not see any passage in Lucan to the under·
standing of which this connexion is a direct help. The Eastern
or Western ‘North-and-South·lines' are nothing more nor less

As the identity oi a painter shews itseli in certain peculiaritis t

arities ol diction and rhythm. But perhaps more‘attentionis
nowadays bestowed upon the caseos the painter‚ which appe-‘all
to the eye, than upon that of the poet, which must be decided
by the ear. Yet that the diction and rhythm oi a poem arey
among its important characteristics will hardly be denied bys}
caresul reader of the Aeneid or Paradise Lost. in the case oi}
Lucan this line os inquiry has special interest: sor, though it isi
easy to note in detail the numerous traces os Vergil's influenoe'
on the writer of the Pharsalia, it is none the less true that
the effect os the whole poem is anything but Vergilian. Indeed
it cannot be said to bear a general resemblance to any other
work in ancient literature that has come down to us. It stands*
between the old Rome and the new, not only in its subject and
spirit but also in its rhythm and diction.

The general effect os Lucan’s verse is one of steady monotony.
Looking more closely we observo certain distinct reasons for

this effect, which are in the main as follows:
