Such are a few out of many instances of a correspondence
›urely more than casual between the words of Juvenal and
Lucan. Ido not think it will be disputed that the later poet
lrew inspiration from the earlier. To what extent he did so,
1 think no mere comparison of line and line will tell us. Rather
xe must pass from one to the other in our reading and remark
he frequent likeness of manner and tone. Take such lines as
lte following:

11 74 consul et eversa felix moriturus in urbe.
¹7¹ omnia Sullanae lustrasse cadavera pacis.
111 439 ..sed expensa superorum et Caesaris ira.

tx 706-7 sed quis erit nobis lucri pudor? inde petuntur
huc Libycae mortes, et fecimus aspida mercem.

Read too such passages as lv 373—401,V 381—402‚ vn 5 39
-43, x 136—71‚ and many more, and it is Ι think hardly
possible to doubt that the satirist had drunk very largely of
Lucan’s spring :-naturally and rightly, for the manner and tone
of lucan, though unsuited to an epic poem, find their proper
place and function as a vehicle of satire. ·
