eii SUBSTANTIVES AND ADJECTIVES

New adjectives are not very common, and are seldom happy
inventions Specimens are the following, mostly ἅπαξ λεγό-

va.
με Iv 406 bellax, VI 22 peramabilis, VIII 175 inocciduus [Seu
epigr 36 Baehrens], Ix 408 irredux, 941 lrarenivagus.

Ι Some rare words seem taken from Ovid, such as
VI1480 resonas, IX 670 saxificos, 677 colubrifer.

The neuter ol the adjective is very commonly treated asa

' substantive. Vergil does this to a less extent, Horace osten.

Specimens are

1530, 1v 55, 111413 serenum, 11389, v111490‚ 111404 563,
571 honestum, IV 248 iustum, VIII 488 utile, rectum,
lx 189, 577,Χ 189 verum.

As to the forms os nouns there is little to be said exoept
that the genitive in ii, made popular by Ovid and others, is now
regular. Lucan has auxilii, conirgii, corm'lii, eloquii, imperii,
naufragii, servitii, solstitii.

In x 187 we have the unique fastibus [abl offam} and in
IV 520 felix [acc neut] is so sar as Ι know only supported by
the use os the nominative in quod bonnm faustum selah...siet,
where it does not stand alone. For VII 391 natale [abl] see

Roby1§§425,427.

Nothing is more remarkable in Lucan than the extreme
fluctuation in the sense os certain substantives Nisard [II pp
238-45]‚ who holds that metrieal convenience has had a great

deal to do with this abandonment ol the comparative precision
observed by the Augustan writers, selects the following speci-
mens :

fides. 1467, 11 17, 254, 705, vr 433, v11 192, v111 688, 111 5852
etc

focdm. 18o,11 378,1v 365, rx 1048, x 471, ete

mors [with letum],
