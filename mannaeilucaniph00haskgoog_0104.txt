(a) Want of variety in the pauses, What canbe done
by such variety in Latin had already been shewn by Vergil,
no doubt at the cost of enormous but congenial labour.

Two os Lucan’s favourite pauses¹ are after the strong pen·
themimeral and hephthemimeral caesuras as

157 sentiet axis onus! ι 50 igne vago lustrare iuvetl
58 orbe tene mediol 61 inque vicem gens omnis amet!
63 sed mihi iam numen. Ι 68 immensumque aperitur opus. Ι
l 72 nec se Roma ferens! 82 crescendi posuere modurn!

¹ 77 excutietque fretum! 84 invidiam Fortuna suam!
93 impatiens consortis erit Ι

When the ear is trained to notice such things, the constant
recurrence of these and other pauses becomes quite painful:
such sameness of the rhythmic beat is an artistic crudity that
may be excused but cannot be made pleasing.

(b) Want os variety in the rhythm of successive lines.
This is a grave defect even when not emphasized by marked

pausem and here too Vergil had shewn the better way. ‘sake
such a passage as 11 16-42. The matter is such as might
bave wrought mightily on a Roman poet and sound its utterance
iu memorable words of noble sound. But through weakness of
rhythm and diction the passage is dull and commonplace. The
tame may be said oi a great many other passages; and when
the matter has no particular interest of its own the effect is of
oourse worse. That Lucan could have given more rhythmic
variety than he has done may I think be proved by lines of
Vergilian ring that lie here and there imbedded in his work.

For instance

395 procumbunt nemora, et spoliantur robore silvae.
