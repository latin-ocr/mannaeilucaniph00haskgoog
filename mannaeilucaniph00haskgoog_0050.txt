NERO AND THE EMPIRE Ι

¹ 3⁴³ ⁴ in scelus it Pharium Romani poena tyranni,
exemplumque perit.

In a few passages the direct reference is to tyranny or
monarchy in general, touching the Empire indirectly.

1670 cum domino pax ista venit.

1161 uter imperet urbi.

l W stt-9

¹ non tamen ignavae post haec exempla virorum
percipient gentes quam sit non ardua virtus
servitium fugisse manu ; sed regna timentur
ob ferrum, et saevis libertus uritur armis
ignoratque datos ne quisquam serviat enses.

tx 566-7
quid quaeri, Labiene, iubes-an liber in armis
occubuisse velini potiusquam regna videre?

111108 o bona libertas. [in bitter irony]

x 2⁶-e non utile mundo
editus exemplum, terras tot posse sub uno
esse viro.

To these and other less notable lines of the same tone add
tte frequent references to the murder of Caesar and tyrannicide
hgeneral, and our body of evidence is pretty complete.

And now—to what conclusions does this evidence lead us?
We have flattery of Nero: we have tirades against despotism :—
fove infer (a) that he began by liking the Emperor, and as he
vent on grew to loathe both Emperor and Empire, or (b) that he
tated both from the first, and praised Nero in irony, or (c) that
teis content with the Emperor throughout, but loathes the
Empire? For my part l cannot see any direct evidence of
personat hostility¹⁰ to Nero, and I do not think that his praise of
fleto is ironical. But 1 do think that bitter loathing of the
Empire is one of the chief, if not the chief, influences that
tninrate the poem. Are we then to conclude that this loathing
ofthe Empire-Tyranny‚ as he calls it-—means that Lucan
eriously desired and aimed at the overthrow of the imperial
monarchy and the reestablishment of an aristocratic Republic?

¹ lf ve adopt the fust of the tvo suppositione on the contrary still in book lx anxious to please
ts to the 'trojan episode (see above), Lucan is Nero.
