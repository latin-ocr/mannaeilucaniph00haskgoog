din os battle⁶⁶ rises to the pure Olympian aether, far above
the region oi clouds and thunder: the sling-bullets melt with
the speed of their flight. Cornelia calls herself ⁶⁸ Julia’s paelex.
Cato draws off the fleet: 300 ships are spoken 0f⁸⁷ as 1000t
In Africa a waterspout⁸⁸ never breaks up: a sandstorm sweeps
the sand even from under a man’s feet: only the looseness
os the surface earth saves the solid earth beneath from sheer
destruction by the wind: yet the soldiers are saud-bound by
the piling-up ol sand round them. After the region os serpentS,
Cato's men are cheered⁵⁹ by the sight os lions. Alexander,
who turned back from the Satlej, sheds the blood ol' Indians‘
on the Ganges.

(e) The truth ol the matter is that the old warmth‚ the
human interest, of early poetry was dead. In early poetry,
as Nisard⁶¹ well remarks, Man is everything; the scene is
merely accessory: even the gods are only superhuman men.
Such we find the state of things in the'Homeric poems. When

we get to Vergil, human interest is still there3 but the scene
has become more important, the human actors less so. De-
scriptive passages are introduced with obvious relish, though
as yet sparingly: erudition is an important part os the poet’s
equipment‚ though as yet it is not ostentatiously displayed
When we reach Lucan, the poetry ol the Homeric type is
dead. The men are little more than lay figures the scene is
everything. Lucan still tries to draw characters but the colours
are harsh, the touches coarse, the traits inconsistent. The old
religious beliels were no longer able to supply any warmtb.
There was nothing left lor the poet but to describe⁰ the
material aspects ol things, to display erudition, to declaim
by the mouths of his characters or in his own person. And
it was natural that in the endeavour to awalren by such means
