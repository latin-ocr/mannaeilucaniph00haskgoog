ELISION. ENDINGS xcvii

eld, and that Lucan could not free himself from its influence.
'outh also has probably something to do with the defect os
suoen's verse: and, though the cases are not quite analogous‚
e reminds us os Oldham in Dryden's lines

O early ripe! to thy abundant store

what could advancing age have added more?
lt might (what nature never gives the young)
have taught the numbers os thy native tongue:
but satire needs not those, and wit will shine
through the harsh cadence os a rugged line

A noble error and but seldom made,

when poets are by too much force betrayed.

(c) Too sparing use of elision. In Vergil's hands elision³
vas a powersul rhythmic appliance: by it he was able to load
or roughen lines or parts os lines so as to regulate the move-
ment; and thus he makes sound and sense agree. In this
respect Lucan’s rhythm⁴ is decidedly weak. The same may be
said of Ovid and of the post-Vergilian poets generally. lbelieve
that false rhetorical training had a great deal to do with this
defece

(d) Want os variety in the endings of lines. The
spondaic ending occurs in the Pharsalia sourteen⁵ times only,
and in eleven of these sourteen cases the last word is either a
Greek word or a proper name or both. Still the number of
such endings would not seem so very small were it not that the
spondaic is almost the only abnormal ending employed by
Lucan There are only two⁸ other cases of variation and the
last word is Greek in both cases.

(e) Slovenly assonance of endings. This unhappy
jingling is frequent, and mars the sound of some of the best
passages in the poem. A few instances will illustrate this
lelect clearly enough. For brevity's sake l give the endings
only.
