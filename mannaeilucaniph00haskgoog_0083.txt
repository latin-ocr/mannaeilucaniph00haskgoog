of the same ideas with change of vocabulary, and is worth
reading carefully from this point of view, being eminently

typical of Lucan's manner. As Nisard says, he goes from
the word to the thing, not from the thing to the word.

(b) The plague of catalogues²¹ is found more or less in
every part of the narrative The age was an age of common·
place-books: it produced Pliny's Natural History. Accordingly
Lucan, ever in excess, when he once begins to speak of this οι
that matter, falls into the cataloguing vein and wears the topic
threadbare. For instance:

When Caesar is withdrawing his scattered forces from
Gaul we get a list¹¹ of Gaulish places and tribes, in which
two subordinate digressions are imbedded. Pompey‘s retreat
to Capua leads to an account¹⁴ of the physical geography of
Italy, with one digression. The forces gathered to support
Pompey are catalogued¹⁸ at vast and weary length: 125 lines
of it are introduced by 2 good lines of preface and closed
by 2 passable lines of summary. The dreary episode¹⁶ of the
siege of Massalia is spun out to nearly 400 lines of tasteless and
hyperbolical detail; while the main point, the surrender, drops
out altogether. We may be thankful that the realm and foroes
of Juba are dismissed¹⁷ in 16 lines. The topic of the Delphic
oracle¹⁸ is better handled, but the moralizing discussion is the
best part of it It takes some 150 lines before we get back to
the subject of the war. The storm in which Caesaris caught
on the Adriatic is so described¹⁹ that at the end of about 60 lines
we are heartily sick of it; our impressions of the storm are con·
fused by the bombastic language and ingenuity of material
details, and the whole effect is execrable. lt takes 80 lines*
to set forth the physical geography and mythical history of
