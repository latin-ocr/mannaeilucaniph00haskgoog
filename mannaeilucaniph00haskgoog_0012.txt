PREFACE.

Tffls edition of Lucan is intended to meet the want
which is, ,Ι believe, often felt, of an edition with English
notes suited for students at the University and the
higher forms in Schools. Ι have not made any attempt
to produce a critical text, but have followed for the most
part that of Weise; the references in the notes to differ-
ences i'n the readings of the manuscripts are mainly
drawn from the edition of Oudendorp (Leyden‚ 1728).
I have also had constantly before me the edz'tzb princeps
published at Rome in the year 1469, of which there are
two copies in the Library of St John's College.

· criticise the prooss of the notes Ι am also indebted to
l the Rev. J. Έ. Β. mayor, Professor or Latin in the
