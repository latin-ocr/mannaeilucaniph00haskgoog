MEYAPHORS ' lxxxix

(c) Those borrowed directly¹ from earlier poets‚ above all
from Vergil. These are numerous.

One grave defect which a careful reader will often note in
¹ Lucan's use of similes is that he over-describes that which he is
about to illustrate by a comparison. Then, when the simile does
come, it falls flat. The reason for which I take to be as follows.
A simile expresses similarity of relations, not exact equality of
ratios. Its purpose therefore is to furnish a qualitative standard,
not a quantitative one. By first over-describing the thing com·
pared, the quality is already sufficiently characterized, and the
simile finds its work done. It then has a sort of quantitative
effect. Thus, when Pompey and Caesar are severally described
by analysing their characters and careers, it is of little use to
compare them respectively to an old oak and a thunderbolt.
The similes seem to answer the questions ‘how stationary
is P? how restless is C?' not the questions ‘what sort of man
isP? what sort is ct’ And the rhetorical simile fails when
applied to exact mensuration.

Another defect is the frequent introduction of things not
seen or not known or less so to illustrate things seen or known
or more so.

Both these defects arise from employing¹ the simile to make
the thing compared more interesting rather than more clear.
And only a great master can do this with success.

To treat of the metaphors of Lucan exhaustively is quite
beyond my reach with the time at my disposal ; nor do I greatly
regnet this. I can do no more than give references for samples

'ol some of the chief metaphors.

ἶ First 1 would observe that Lucan, like most poets‚ mixes
metaphors; and that he does so in a singularly harsh manner.
,. lustances of mixture are the following:

pe· 1159 [semina...mersere], 262-4 [faces stimulos, moras]

f· v118—9 [stimulq fluctu, labat], VI 7-8 [alea...mersura],
603 [praeponderet...alea], VI1504—5 [pondera,torrente].
