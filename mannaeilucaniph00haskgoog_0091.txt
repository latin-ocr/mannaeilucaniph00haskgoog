Where Lucan repeats the word in the same sense we 210
conscious 01 2 00112111 dullness and monotony, such as a meagre
vocabulary is apt to convey. Where the sense of the word is

great carelessness. It is sar otherwise in the simple diction 01
archaic poetry. But with such Lucan has nothing in common,
