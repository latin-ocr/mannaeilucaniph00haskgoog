lxxii FOUR CHARACTERISTIC DEFEC Τ S

Pons characteristic defecta

(46) Four oi the main literary deiects os the Pharsalia are
best grouped together, both because they are oi necessity some· ·
what ahin to each other, and because the passages adduced
under each head often serve to illustrate what is to be said
under others. The following classification has been adopted as
convenient.

(a) The clearness oi a picture is marred and its effect spoilt
by overloading it with detail. lt is materialized.

(b) Long lists or enumerations are introduced, which break
the flow oi narrative and are in themselves mostly weari-
some.

(c) Narratives and discussions os a descriptive or moralizing
nature are brought in unnecessarily, and often spun out to
great length: by these the poem is broken and made
heavy, being in lact a vehicle ior carrying great quantities
oi utterly irrelevant matter.

(d) Hyperbole is employed to excess; that is, Lucan en·
dcavours to engage the interest and lire the imagination
oi the reader by overdrawn description and gigantic ma·
chinery: the effect ot' this is¹ simply to dwarf the human
agents who appear on the scene.

(a) The excess oi detail is observable throughout the poem
To take a iew instances:

Speaking oi the cruel murder os Marius' brother, Lucan¹
thinks fit to enlarge on the ghastly brutality oi the deed step
by step, quite needlessly.

Marcia returns to be remarried⁸ to Cato. The marriage
takes 22 lineS, 17 of which describe the usages dispensed with
by the pair, 3 those complied with; 2 are introductory.
