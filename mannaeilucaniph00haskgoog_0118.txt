RELA TION TO VERGIL cx

lhave collected a great number of passages on which the

ontrary opinion may as Ι think securely rest. These passages
light be classified under three heads

(a) those in which it is quite clear that the words of Lucan
are an echo of the words of Vergil.

(b) those in which a word, atum of phrase, a construction,

or the sound of a line, are curiously alike in the two
writers Of these I have only given a selection.

(c) those in which the wonderful correspondente of geo-
graphical details, proper names, legendary lore, and
other such material, is marked.

:asaal resemblances will ever be found in poems written in the
ame metre and language. But when the resemblances are very
numerous when the line or lines of the earlier poet occur in or
near a passage already proved to have been well known to the
later poet and certainly imitated or echoed by him-then the
caseis materially altered, and the value of this class of evidence
becomes manifest Now anyone who carefully studies the
parallel passages quoted below will see that the most remark-
able characteristic of the parallelisms in general is the way in
which disproportionately large numbers are furnished by certain
parts of Vergil.

Ihold therefore that Lucan was steeped in the language of
Vergil, and closely familiar with his matter. I think that
a puori probability-a poor thing in itself—tends also to this
conclusion ; for the popularity of Vergil was immediate, and
Seneca’s frequent quotations from his works suffice to prove that
this popularity extended to the circle of society in which Lucan
vas brought up. Again,we find Lucan’s contemporary Calpurnius
&manifest imitator of the Bucolics. Indeed so universal was
lle influence of Vergil that the best great division os Roman
literature is that into ante· and post-Vergilian.
