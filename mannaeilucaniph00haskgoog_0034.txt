ST OlCISM AND RHETORIC

ι best masters, and under the eye of his uncle¹⁰ Seneca. Seneca
however passed the most part of the next ten yeais in banish-
ι ment Before his return to Rome in 49 ΑΙ) the young Lucan
J· had become a pupil of some grammarian, most probably of
ἓ QRhemnius Fannius Palaemon¹¹ whose school was then much
,invogue Next he would be put under some rhetorician. When
be left this teacher he passed into the hands of Cornutus¹⁹, a
highly respected expounder of the Stoic Philosophy. While
under this celebrated master he is said to have formed a friend·
thip with his follow-pupil¹⁸ Persius, who in his satires speaks of
Cornutus with admiring love. Among the many promising
pupils in these schoolsv Lucan is said to have been the one
whose precocious cleverness attracted most attention. ’
(16) Rhetoric and Stoic dogma were an essential part of
Lucan's family heritage3 they were also the staple of his mental
mining. Fora much-petted quick-witted youth, plunged into
such a society as that of Rome in the first century of our era,
hardly any training could be more mischievous In most natures
ue sels-conscious morality of Stoicism tended to beget an un-

3ttarrantable arrogance and contempt for others: while the
rhetoric of the schools, made up of phrase-worrying and devotion
lotinsel ornament, was well suited to make young minds
uistake words for things and vitiate a man's taste through life.
ln an old man perhaps the evil might have been found cor-
reted, his taste mellowed and his pride abascd, by the ex-
perience of life and the chastening uses of the world. But

'l'he Life of Persius names him as· toacher of that
writer. On what authority the statement of two
of the later lives of Lucan, that he was a pupil
of Verginius Flavus the rhetoricinn, may rest, l

know not.

boldness and refusal to flatter Nero see epit

suggests that he was n freedmnu of the Anrtaean
family (Lecture on Persius, p xvi).
