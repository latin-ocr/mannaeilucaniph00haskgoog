lxxii NARRATIVES ANB DISCUSSIONS

passages are often of considerable merit in themselves, and the
objection fairly to he urged against them is that they are un·
suited to this poem, some to any poem.

When Lucan discusses⁸ the causes of the civil war ina
passage which, if not original, is certainly a powerful and
pointed one, we feel that we are out of the proper domain
of cpic poetry: itis all cold and analytical.

When Pompey on his way to Brundisium makes a speech
of 65 lines⁸⁸ to his soldiers‚ the reader feels that if both right
and might are really on the side of the speaker the fact ought
not to need so lengthy a proof. When the poet desires to say·⁸
that Pompey's success before Dyrrachium, if well followed up,
would have saved much unnecessary bloodshed by ending the
war then and there, he does not say simply ‘Ah, if only Sulla
had been in Pompey’s placel' he goes on to tell us what
would not have happened if he had been The temptation
to moralize in detail is too much for him. The reflexions⁸
before and after the great battle are so fine in themselves
that they disarm criticism: still they are rather fine as de·
clamation than as sense or poetry. The same is true of the
noble lines³⁸ the burdcn of which is ⁴ Better to fall with Pompey
than win with Caesar’ ; and of the ferocious and malignant
picturc⁸⁷ of Caesar and his men after the battle, a sort of
attempt at literary vengeance in a lost cause.

A melancholy instance of misused opportunities is the de-
scription'l of Caesar’s visit to the Hellespont and Troy, where
the effect of the situation is lost in the attempt to moralize
and catalogue at once.

The reflexions'⁹ on Alexander suggested by caesar‘s visit
to his tomb are another case of the ruinous effect, from a
literary point of vieW, of this tendency to run off at length
into a sermon where what was needed was one or two power-
ful touchcs‚ such as stimulate a reader to make the sermon
sor himself. As instanccs of the discussion of natural phe-
nomena we may take the digression⁴⁰ on certain tides ln the
