xxxvi RIVAL COMPOSITION OF PETRONIUS

Pharsalica bella: but the title Pharsalia now in vogue sce
to come solely from Lucan's own words 1x 985 Pharsalia aas ”
viaet etc. Ι do not think that this need mean more than ‘ ms
tale of Pharsalia will live,' and therefore Ι cannot adopt Teuffel&
bold statement ,that this' rs the authent t1c title, without resera&
The other name seems more appropriate, and I am contemto
remain in doubt where certainty seems out of reach. Ι should
add, though without laying much stress on the fact, that lea
tronius ἕ 118 in leading up to his poem or fragment on the ἀνί ,
war says balli civilis ingens apas,· and the words are with good ¹
reason held to allude to the poem of Lucan ’

(31) Ifeel bound to sayafew words here on th1s poenos
Petroniu5‚ at presen fragment of 295 lines. The purposeof
it is unmistakeable: it is thrown off half‘ m rivalry hallin Ι
imitation of Lucan,' m fact rather like our well· known‘ Rejected ϊ

smoot ther and perhaps more elegant than Lucan; but the uu· Δ
portance attached to mere literary tricks and supernatural-
machinery is very remarkable, as Petronius' own words shewit Τ

(82) Now Teuffel [ἕ 305] remarks that the reason why wem?
do not fmd Lucan's name mentioned by Petronius‘ in this ton·-
nexion is that Lucan was then living. With this Ι fully agree,
But a new point has now to be considered. The poem is full ο f
obvious reminiscences of the Pharsalia, chiefly of the ears, ³
part, as is natural. But, if there be also reminiscences of the
later books, then we must believe that the Pharsalia was pub-
lished at its present length (or nearly so) in the lifetime of
Lucan. The evidence of such reminiscences is just strong'
enough to make me incline to this view, but not enough to
produce certainty. lt is as follows :

Petronius Lucan

14—6 quaeritur in silvis auro fem et lx 706-7 [just after passage ahod l
ultimus Hammon Afrorum excuti· Hammon] sed quid erit nobis lut-
tur‚ ne desit belua dente acl mortes pudor? inde petuntur huc Libyas*
pretiosa. mortes et fecimus aspida mercem.

⁶ Petronius was compelled to death early in 66 an, Luem in 65.
