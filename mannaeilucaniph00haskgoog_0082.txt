EX CESS OF DE TAIL lxxiii

words are glibly condensed and read like those of a man
speaking from a brief dictionary of biography.

The Massaliots declare⁵ that their loyalty will stand the test
ofenduring the hardships of a siege: they go into particulare in
away that robs their manful declaration of all its dignity.

While the armies are facing each other before Ilerda a
severe drought is followed⁶ by a disastrous downpour of rain.

polines of tasteless overdrawn description bring us to a point
where the effect of the rainfall‚ plus a simile, plus an apostrophe
to Juppiter and Neptune, are yet to follow.

Curio is deceived bya stratagem of Juba, and his men are
indeed in a desperate position⁷. But 15 lines is too much to
devote to a description of the distress of the horses and the em-
barrassment caused thereby, when the lives of the whole army
are in jeopardy.

Caesar on his voyage over the Adriatic⁸ is becalmed. We
are first told this clearly enough in 6 lines, then comes a simile
in6more. But the breeze is not yet. Through 14 more lines
we have to vait, knowing all the while that it must come.
And these lines in effect tell us that Caesar was in a dead
calm and wanted a breeze, which we knew before.

The preparations for the great battle move Lucan to
compare⁹ the scene to the preparations of the gods for battle
with the Giants He then takes 5 gods and works through
them saying something appropriate of each. This is meant
fobe graphic and is miserable.

After the victory, Caesar's men sleep a guilty restless sleep¹⁰
in the Pompeian camp. Down to the words orienes iw Caesare
manes the description is really fine ; but then comes a tasteless
double simile, followed by 3 lines harmless in themselves but
quite superfluous

In.the course of Cato’s march along the African coast the
story of the apples of the Hesperides is dragged in¹¹ on slight
pretext. This passage well illustrares the tiresome recurrence
