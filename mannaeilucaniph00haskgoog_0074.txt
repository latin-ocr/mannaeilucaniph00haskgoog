SENTENTIAE

pectus et aversi petit oscula grata mariti,
omentis mirata genos percussaque caeco

Surely the lad ol twenty five years who wrote this stands on
aheight from which the ingenuity os a critic¹⁸ who will venture
lo determine what he could and could not have done, is he had ²
lived out the ordinary span, may be complacently ignored.

Sententiae.

(43) Lucan is described by Quintilian¹ as sententiis claris-
simus: it is therefore part of my business to inquire what is the
lull meaning ol the description, and how lar it can be accepted
as applicable to our author.

Ι The word sententia is used as the equivalent of γνώμη, and
· signifies¹ a maxim or general statement. By the rhetoricians
² the word is applied only to such general utterances as have a
bearing upon human lise and action. In this sense I shall use
it From being a staple material of early poetry, and an
appliance moderately used by orators in the golden ages of
Greek and Roman political lise, it had now in the hands os
the rhetoricians os the Empire become an artificial embellish·
ment used with little relevance or moderation. Speaking of
senemr‘as Quintilian⁸ says nostris temporibus modo carent. The
elder Seneca speaking ol Porcius Latro says‘ that he would
sometimes compose m'nil praeteriens translaticias qnos proprie
sententias dicimus, qnae niln'l liabent enm ipsa controversia im·

plicitum sed satis apte et alio transferantur, tamqnam qnae de
fortuna de crudelitate a’e saeculo de divitiis dieantur: leoc genas

sententiarum supellectilem vocabat,
