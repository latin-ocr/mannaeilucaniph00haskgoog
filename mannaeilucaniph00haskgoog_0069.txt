lx WHO IS THE HERO?

¹¹ 73⁴f0¹h but free. True to his principles, he is unmoved by the horrid deaths ὡ

him-²¹ make the march hideous‚ sadly and sternly he gives his orders and pushes orti
he bears the worst of every peril: in his presence the voice of complaintb
hushed, and the tortured victims die in peace. With the end of this merci
we again lose sight of Cato. lf there is one part of Lucan¹s dcsign thenon
completion of which we may justly regrct, surely it is the famous death m
at Utica, which the Stoic poet doubtless intended to pourtray,

Such is Lucan’s Cato. Those who are familiar with ther
contemporary references of Cicero and the speech recordedty
Sallust* will see that it is in its main outlines a truthful picture.¹
lt is true that we miss the cross-grained perversity that movet
the mockery and complaints of Cicero. So far the picture seems
onesided. But it is to be remembered that it was preciselyinn
great crisis like that of the civil war that Cato would appear tn
the best advantage· Of course the portmit is coloured by a lonrg
hand: but it is none the worse for that.

Cato was too much at variance with the corrupt politiciant
of his age, too deficient in pliability‚ too little able to employ
the best of possible means for the attainment of the best attain-
able ends, too much in fact of the hard narrowminded masterfni
Roman Stoie, to be a successful or practical man in times nf
comparative peace. But the Cato of Lucan-even ifwe grant
that heis more of a concrete ideal than a human character-is
essentially great, and, if we judge him by his own standard, es·
sentially successful. If asa man he has not the truebalanced
mind and masterly harmony of Caesar, by the side of poor nordy
vacillating Pompey he is simply colossal, lt is his ‘vain faitb
and courage vain’ that alone lights up the dark hour of the falling
Commonwealth. Such men are ever misunderstood in their life
time; and we may well believe that Cato expected nothing else,
and that to him the loving admiration of posterity would have
seemed a fitting and sufficient reward. Manilius⁶ sets his soul,
with the rest of the good and great, among the stars of heaven:
there he, fortunae victor, might live a congenial life in his aetherial
home in calm enjoyment of the Universe.

in the Pharsalia. The Senate as a powerful governing body was
of coursea thing of the past: it could only be known to Lucan
as such from books or from the prejudiced and inaccurate de·
