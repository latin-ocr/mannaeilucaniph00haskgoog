(c) While considering the feats of Lucan in the way of
ntitheses and emphasis it may be well to call attention to
he involved and laboured expression of notions in themselves
leat and capable of being expressed simply and clearly. Ι take
he instances collected by Nisard 11 pp 246- 51, as they are
:ood ones and amply sufficient to illustrate this characteristic of
'sucan’s style.

ruz-6 [it was the submission to a triumvirate, not the power of an
merny, that destroyed Rome], 11 177—80 [Marius was killed with cruel slow-
resq, 111 457-61 [the motive power of the towers was unseen‚ and when they
1110011 it seemed like the effectos earthquake], rx 636-41 [Medusa tums to
stone all who look upon her face. For the description of instantaneous

terh cf Seneca nat quaest 11 59 ξ 13]-
Tnese examples might be multiplied to any extent.

(d) Ι append a few stray notes which seem to belong to
this place.

Tne figure hendiadys‚ so common in Vergil, is very rare in Lucan.
See 1v 364 urum belli poenamque remittit, and a few more scattered in-
fian

{se figure hypallage is common in Lucan. Instances are vn 623-4

quir pectore tela transmittat, 834—5 numquam tanto sc vulture coelum
induit, 111 457 [turres] nullo fixerunt robore terram.

(e) Among the characteristics of Lucan’s style we must
not forget the careless repetition of words, The effect of this
issometimes very awkward‚ and has sometimes even caused
editors to attempt the emendation of lines which on further
consideration seem to be indubitably sound. A few instances
vill illustrate and justify my words.
