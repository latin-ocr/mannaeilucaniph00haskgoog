xxx PLOT FAILS. DEATH OF LUCAN

soul with notions of a Roman constitution and a Republican
liberty in themselves historically untrue and which even as
ideals were no better than an idle tale. And while he thus
inflated his seli-conceit and nursed his wrath he lost the last

· traces of common sense and power of self-judgment. Blind to

his own inexperience of men and his unfitness to conducta
delicate and momentous enterprise, he plunged into the con·
spiracy with hot vehemence and became one of the leadersof
the plot. But while he boasted and fumed the news came-4¹
upon him that all was discovered and himself betrayed. Ther}
followed a sad scene of abasement and shame. The γουηεξ
Stoic begged for his life. He was ordered to give the namet ¹
of accomplices. At first he refused: he was then offered his 'j‘ss
life as the price of betrayal. It was useless to question the
good saith of the offer, which could only be tested by accepting .
it. It was equally useless to name strangers or slight aequans
ances: for his previous hesitation would not be accounted fon
and further inquiry‚ probably torture, 'would follow. Lucu
shewed what he thought of his own position when he accused
his mother Acilia. We have no reason to think that the charge
had any foundation, and we are tolo³² that the lady was not
molested in consequence. Lucan however did not escape by
means of an act almost worthy⁸³ of the matricide Emperor
himself. When he received the order to die, he had his veint-
opened ιη the approved fashion³⁴ and died the theatrical ἀεηὼγῖ
of a Roman Stoico sthose evil days. ²
