1 proceed to consider briefly the similes os Lucan. It seem
to me that we may classisy them under three heads according ί
their sources

(a) These from life, that is, within the range os the writdi
own experiente. A very small class, including perhapsa
deathbed scene, a streeoe accident, a poisoning, and a feu
drawn from the amphitheatre and circus.

(b) Those from history, mythology, geography, works of an
books os natural history and travel. These may be castet*
the encyclopaedie class, and they are very numerous.
