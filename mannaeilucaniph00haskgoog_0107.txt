ln such a case as 11 143-4 periere nocentes, sed cum iam
soli possent superesse nocentes, there is a rhetorical point in the
assonanee3 and there need be little doubt that it is to the
fashion os the rhetorical sehools that this tendency in Lucanis
mainly due. But that mere carelessness or defective ear has
something to do with ir is I think shewn by such a passage
as lx 3 5 5—8

quam iuxta Lethon tacitus praelabitur amnis
infernis, ut fama, trahens oblivia vent's;

But-not to mention that the only elision is that of the que
in atque, which is practically none at all‚-the recurrence of the
termination nis [1113 nis nis nis], followed by two words ending
in tus separated by one ending in bus, is hideous, let who will
say the contrary. While 011 this subject let me add that Lucan
almost rivals the famous O fortunatam natam me consule
Romam of Cicero 111111 110 res mihi Romanas dederas, Fortuna,

regendas.

strictly rhythmic. It only touches rhythm by reason of the
various qualities of the letters. By skilful alliteration special
