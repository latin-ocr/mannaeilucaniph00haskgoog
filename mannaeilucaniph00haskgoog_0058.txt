(86) Relation to Religion.

After considering the relations of Lucan to contemporary
philosophy it may not be out of place to add a few words on
the religions of the age and his references to them.

(a) The break-up of the old Roman beliefs in the latter days of
the Republic was followed by the great statedirected revival under
Augustus In its outward observances the national religion, a medley
of indigenous and imported elements, was to a remarkable extent
restored. But the ancient faiths‚ if they had ever exercised a sway over
men’s minds and controlled their lives, had long lost this power and
could never recover it again. Not only had Greek speculation destroyed
the intellectuat basis of belief, but the characters attributed to the
gods¹⁷ served to disgust the good and fumished an excuse, if such were
needed, to the votaries of vice and crime.

No wonder then that Roman society turned to the East and to
the West for the satisfaction of its emotional or quasi-spiritual needs.
Under the Roman tolerance of alien worships‚ only interrupted now and
then for reasons of state, new gods and new systems of religion were
mou domiciled in the great city. From Syria and Asia Minor and
above all from Egypt came the Oriental cults of excitement and mystery,
rrirh their orgies initiations mutilations and symbolisms: and crowds
rere drawn after them. The Jews too, worshipping the one and
invisible god in sullen scorn, found protection and won not a few¹⁰
proselytes Rome was even invaded by the horrid divinities and darlr
superstitious of Britain and Gaul.

Patriotic orthodoxy suppressed the Dmidical religion in Rome and
evenmallg for reasons of policy, crushed it also in its native seats.
