APOSTROPHES lxxi

The influence of the rhetorical schools is very plain to see in
v319-454 [Caesar to mutinous troops]‚ 481—97 [Caesar to
Antony]‚ vl11 622—35 [Pompey's absurd dying soliloquy]‚
1x1014—32 [i Pothinus to Caesar].

l That influence may be well illustrated by comparing 1v
344—62 with Quintus Curtius vl11 14 ᾗ 42, v 682—99 with
Curtius lx 6 ἓξ 6-15, and lx 848—80 with Curtius lx 3
§5-15 and the first suasoria os the elder Seneca: it will
be felt that these passages (and scores of others, no doubt)
are merely school commonplaces.

1t may also be interesting to examine pairs os answering
speeches, such as v 739-59‚ 762-90 [Pompey and Cornelia]‚
v11 aso-329, 342-82 [Caesar and Pompey], vm 262-327,
331-453 [Pompey and Lentulus].

Of Lucan's apostrophes there is not much to be said. There
are in them many fine passages-some of his very best rhetoric,
—but their effect on the poem as a whole is bad. The reason is
elear; they are the outcome os an unhealthy sels-consciousness.
The poet's business is surely to develope his moral by the
simple interaction of characters and circumstances. The reader
should be left to judge: half the pleasure and most of the profit
of poetry lies in the discovery of the moral significance of the
characters and the meaning of the story, not by direct state·
ment, but from the story and characters themselves. Now
Lucan is always thrusting himself forward to tell us what it
all means: and, whatever Roman audiences may have thought
ol the practice, on us the effect is simply todestroy the illusions
ol poetry and bring us face to face with an orator. The
apostrophes are particularly dominant in the seventh and eighth
books, and their undoubted merit, taken as passages, does not
serve to compensate for their destructive effect on the poem
generally. A fine instance of this class of writing and the
course it naturally follows is 1v 799-824, where we begin
vith an address to Curio 799-804Π then tum to party leaders
generally 805—6, next we moralize 807—10, then address
Curio again 811—3, then return to our moralizing 814—24‚
and close the book and the passage with an epigram. ·
