POE ΤΚ Y

personification of the fleet here is excellent. The frequent da
clamation against the wickedness and horrors of civil war Γ
wearisome; but how vividly is all brought home to the read-
when Lucan bears him down to the nether world and shew
him the same discord at work stirring up the armies of th ·
Roman dead⁸z

effera Romanos agitat discordia nearcis,
impiaque infernam ruperunt arma qcu'etem.

How solemn is the awful gloom that falls upon the armies before
the deadly stmggle, each startled at the other's appearance⁹z

inque uc'cem uoltus tacebris mirantur apertos,
et pallere dcun, galeisque incumbere eructem.

Striking too is his description of the after-working of the battle·
fever on the victors in their broken slumbers¹⁰:

inuigilat cunctis saevom scelus, armaque tota
acerete agitant, capuloque manus absente movantur.

Tender is the appeal of Cordus to his departed leader as he lays
the corpse on the wretched pyre¹¹ ; aregium, quantum potu·
acupefiammam, Romana succense uranu. One of the best touches
in the poem is when Cornelia gives to her son the messageof
his father, a charge by which she has been cheated¹¹ into ‚
surviving her husband:

insidiae valuere tuae, deceptaque uiri,
ne milri continuisses auferrem perfida uoces.

Naturally we read of her below¹⁸, saeuamque arte carnplexa de,
larem perfruitur lacrimis et arunt pro coniuge lautum. Indead.
in painting the love of Pompey¹⁴ and Cornelia Lucan is
singularly successful. The parting in Epims, when Pompey'
has made up his mind to send away his wife but dares not tell
her of his resolve ¹⁶, is truly great:

mentem iam uerba paratam
destituant, blandaeque iuuat vecctura tralceutem
indulgere morae et ternpus subducere fatis.
’ nocte sub extrema pulsa turpare quietis
