xxxii GENERAL VIEW

version that renders the true force and spirit os Lucan. Mar·
lowe’s book 1 is too slow and dignified; Sir Arthur Gorges is

too weak and his metre too lowly ; May is halting and often
tame ; and matters are not mended in the pompous dilution ol
Nicholas Rowe. We may wish that Dryden had turned his
talents this way instead oi to proving how unlike Vergil a strong
translation could be.

(2⁶) In considering the poem generally it is well first to
note briefly the contents os the several books, with a lew remarks
on the structure ol the whole.

1. Down to 66 there is nothing to call sor special remark, but thence
onwards to 182 we have a mere analysis ol the causes ol the war, aster
which the action os the poem begins abruptly. To me it seems lar too long

Domitius is important, for he reappears in book v11. This book isan
average one.

Τῖε padding consists chiefly ol 67—2 33 (Marius and Sulla) and 399-438
(ltaly .

111. The main points are, Caesars return to Rome and doings there,
and the siege ol Massalia. The latter of these episodes is so spun out as
to break the general course of the action in a miserable manner. There is

The padding is chiefly 169-297 [catalogue of Pompey's allies].

tv. The fourth book is a book os action, 1—401 contain the campaign
os Ilerda, 402-580 the affair os Vulteius aud his cohort, 661 —824 the fatal
