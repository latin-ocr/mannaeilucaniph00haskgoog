SENTENTIAE lxvii

ll 211 scire mori sors prima viris, sed proxima cogi, 403-4 gaudet
patientia duris: laetius est quotiens magno sibi constat honestum,
583 pavido sortique cadendum est.

X407 nulla fides pietasque viris qui castra sequuntur,

lam aware that Ι may have missed some; but not many, I
think. At all events I feel confident os this, that on the score
ol number there is little to be said. They are not very numerous,
lnow pass on to the more important question of their quality.

We must remember that Lucan’s mental training had con·

sisted principally of school rhetoric and Stoic philosophy. Both
hfluences tended to develope a taste sor sententiae and the
'aculty os composing them. To sententiae his uncle Seneca
rttached no small value, as his practice shews: and he directly
lesends⁵ their use as an engine os practical ethics. Remember-
ng this, and considering also the enormous mass os sententious
tterances existing even now in the works os Lucan's Greek and
'roman predecessors‚—and what now exists is doubtless buta
mall percentage os the total existing in Lucan's day,—we
urely are driven to expect avery high standard os production
o justisy Quintilian's praise. Surely the sententiae ought to
e either original in matter or striking in expression, or both os
rese, is we are to regard the writer as sententiis clarusr'mus.

I am os opinion that these requirements are not adequately
ret by the sententiae os the Pharsalia The matter os them
rsor the most part trite and commonplace‚ and many of them
rerely convey the same tone os cynicism over and over again
1 various forms. The expression is now and then good, but
eldom very striking or neat. ln short my inquiry leads me
2 the conclusion that Quintilian is judging by a low standard,
nd that Lucan has not attained a high one.
