1¹0 the Senecae

(54) This topic cannot be treated at length here. It might
be made the subjectos a complete dissertation. But it would
serve little purpose to prove what is manifest on the face of it
Ἰ that to his grandfather and uncle much of Lucan's pointed
antithetical manner, half rhetorical half Stoic as it is, is to be
θ traced. Reading no doubt that rhetorician's common-place-book,
the suasorz'rze and controversiae of his grandfather, reading and
perhaps often hearing the Stoic sermons of his uncle, he picked
up far more of the mannetisms of the Spanish school (if Ι may
so call it) than we shall ever be able to detect. Numberless
passages can now be illustrated by quotations from the younger
Seneca especially. Resemblances of language (I almost think
it was Seneca who crystallized the everlasting tanti of the
Silver Age) are very frequent: but this line of inquiryI do not
possess either the time or the inclination fully to pursue.

Juvenal's relation to Lucan

(55) It would bea long undertaking to copy out all the
certain or probable reminiscences of Lucan in Juvenal, and quite
nnnecessary to boot. Ι content myself with giving a selection
of parallels in the writings of these two great declaimerS, and
reserve my comments to follow them.
