SPEECHES

speeches and apostrophes

· (4⁵) Lucan, says Quintilian¹, is magis aratoribus quaa
poetis imitandas. This is in a passage where he is passing
poots in review and estimating them according to their relative
values as ‘good reading' lor a student os oratory. I talre
him to mean that the merits os Lucan's treatment and style
are rhetorical, not that all the speeches in the Pharsalia ate

appropriate or judicious. Accepting the criticism in this sense,
l go on to examine brieily the speeches, selecting a lew lor
special comment. ‚ ’

, Their general characteristic is formality: they are set ha·
rangues‚ without individuality²or spontaneousness. Their warmth
and spirit-sor Lucan is, as Quintilian says, ardens anahaitam,-
is the warmth and spirit os a elever young orator, not that ol
the supposed speakers. The same objection may be taken in
a greater or less degree to all speeches written by poets or
historians lor their characters. In Lucan this general resem·
blance is made more striking by the extravagance ol thr
arguments used and the excessive ingenuity ol the tums ol
thought. But when all deduction is made on this score we
must still admit that some of these compositions are admirable
and I mysels think them the best part ol the poem. one
or two os the best apostrophes take a higher ssight3 but on
the whole the speeches bear examination better than the apo·
strophes. ·

Among the best speeches are 1 299—351 [Caesar to hu
troops]‚ IV 212-35 [Petreius to his troops]‚ vl 777-820 [the
corpse]‚ v111 484-535 [Pothinus to'Ptolemy]‚ lx 379-406
[Cato to his troops: down to 394 very good], 566-84 [Cato
thc Stoic]‚ 1064—1104 [Caesar on seeing Pompey’s headl.
x 353—98 [message os Pothinus}

ln worse taste are v111 72-85 [Pompey upbraiding his wile]=
and tx 55-108 [Cornelia who says she has only lived to delium
l‘ompcy’s messagc to her sons, laments too loudly and too long.
with almost ludicrous truth she says ol her anima that plancta

rrmrassa peribit}
