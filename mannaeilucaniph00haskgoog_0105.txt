xcvi RHYTHM

vu 192 Euganeo‚ si vera fides memorantibus, augur ......
548 illic non regum auxiliis collecta iuventus ......

vni 513 causa data est; quid sepositam semperque quietam ......

lx boo-r tumidos iam non capit artus
informis globus et confuso pondere truncus

coepit et in terram Libye spissata reverti.

Here and there we even find a line recalling the stately
rhythm of Lucretius. For instance

vt 487 has avidae tigres et nobilis ira leonum ......
v11 833 Threicias hiemes, ad mollem serius Austrum ......
ix 290 floriferi repetunt, et sparsi mellis amorem'

Sometimes there occurs a variation from his common models
without any corresponding advantage, as lor instance

w 70¹ manibus et mihi sunt tacitae commercia linguae

or sound and sense areat variance, as in

v 437 cnm glacie retinente fretum non impulit ister.

How far this sameness of rhythmic movement is due to a
certain dulness of ear born in the writer, how far to the influente
os the salse rhetoric of the time, an influence under which the
Latin prose period used by Cicero and Caesar was last perishing,
Ι see no means of guessing. But that it was not peculiar to
Lucan Ι inser from the few surviving fragments² os about the
same date, and from the ingenious but monotonous volubility of
the Metamorphoses of Ovid. Ovid's hexameter seems to mark
the transition srom that os Vergil to that of Lucan—so sar, that
is, as we may venture to regard them severally as types. If we
compared together Lucan and Ovid only, their differences would
strike us more forcibly than their resemblances, and naturally:
lor between a sacile writer on a trivial subject and a nervous
declaimer on a theme of world-wide interest the difference is
likely to be enormous. But when we consider how closely Lucan
had studied Vergil, and how little his rhythm is indebted to
Vergil, we may I think fairly conclude that the smoother

Ovidian versification had taken possession of the Roman poetic
