xlviii LIFE ANB DEATH. NON-STOIC ELEMENTS

Both these tendencies are working in Cato. The former is sufficiently illustraled
by what is said above. Cato's devotion to bis country is also one of the most cou-

spicuous features in his character. His aim is patriae impendere vitam. Rome to
him fills the place of wife and child. He makes the bereaved commouwealth his

ward [rx 24 foll]‚ and counts death nothing for her sake. His devotion to the service
of humanity is complete. it is his part toti gertitum se credere mundo. But this
humanity probably includes Romans only in the first place, the rest of the world in
a quite secondary sense.

(h) Life and death are in themselves indifferent Suicide is
sometimes allowed and even enJ'oined. When it has, owing to circum-
stances beyond our control, become undesirable that we should live
longer, then it is time for us to assert our freedom and depart. Zeller

Lucan's utterances on the subject of death are specially interesting horn the
circumstances of his own end.

1n1 459-60 he speaks of the fear of death as timorum maximus. In 111 39-40
he makes Pompey say aut nihil est semus animis a morte relictum, aut mors ipsa
nihil, in V111 749 Cordus says si quid sensus post fata relictum est In V111632
Pompey says non fit morte miser. In 1v 517 foll Vulteius declares that to dieis
a blessing the greatness of which is only disclosed to those whose end is near,
and hidden from the rest. ln his own person he says rv 575-81 non tamen ignavae
posthaec exempla virorum percipient gentes quam sitnon ardua virtus servitium
fugisse manu: sed regna timentur ob ferrum et saevis libertas uritur armis, ignoratque
datos ne quisquam serviat enses. mors, utinam pavidos vitae subducere nolles, sed
virtus te sola daret. Cato says rx arr scire mori sors prima viris. sed proxima
cogi. lt is curious to find that in vn 470-1 di tibi non mortem, quae cunctis poena
paratur, sed sensum postlata ruaedentCrastine, morti, and in vlu 395, death is
spoken of as a penalty. But in vlt 818 libera fortunae mors est it appears again
as a relies, and in v117-8 it is either a penalty or a reward. One of the most
striking passages is in Vulteius’ speech 1v 47⁸7s0¹¹i vita brevis nulli super estqui
tempus in illa quaerendae sibi mortis habet. nec gloria leti inferior, iuvenes, admoto
occurrere fato. omnibus incerto venturae ternpore vitae, par animi laus est et quos
speraveris annos perdere et extremae momentum abrumpere lucis accersas dum fata
mauu: non cogitur ullus velle mori.

(ι) After noting the general Stoic tone of Lucan it is necessary to
remark that we have no ground for thinking that he was so impregnated
with Stoic doctrines as to be a consistent disciple of the Porch. He is
or fancies himself deeply impressed with the wrongfnl predominance of
chance ¹⁶ and indifference of the gods. Hence the prosperity of the
wicked‚ 113448-9 sonat multos Fortuna nocentis et tantum miseris
irasci nurnine possunt. Accordingly we find him now and then breaking
‘out into utterances of distinctly Epicurean sound‚ as when he doubts
