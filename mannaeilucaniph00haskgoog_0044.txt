DIFFICULTIES. PUBLICATION TITLE xxxv

Rome, a fatal influence and one mainly instrumental in destroy-
ing then and lor centuries to come the higher forms of literary
art To these recitations is due that which all critics admit to
be the leading characteristic and great defect os the Pharsalia,
-the sacrifice ol the whole to the parts, neglect of the matter
in an overstudious regard for the manner, a sels-conscious tone
appealing rather to an audience than to a reader‚ venting itsels
in apostrophen scenes, episodes and epigrams, an unhappy
laboriousness that strains itsels to be first-rate sor a moment,
and leaves the poem second-rate lor ever.

(28) 1t is clear enough that Lucan was at a great disad-
vantage in attempting to compose a poem on historical events
oi recent occurrence. Where details are well known, there is
little soope for imagination save in deviation from truth. Indeed
itis sar easier to say what Lucan ought not to have done than
vbat he ought to have done. The plan proposed by Petronius
lor writing a poem on the Civil War would surely produce
something radically bad. For instance, how arethe Godsto
take more part than Lucan gives thern? will they help Caesar

the sreethinker or Pompey the proved sailure? The composition
must have been a literary monster. Criticism os the Pharsalia

must, 1 repeat, be negative from the nature of the case; and
this will serve to explain the tone os much that will be said
below.

(29) According to the Lise os Lucan attributed to Vacca,
only the first three books were published by himself : it is
added that the other seven, which are looked upon as faulty,
vould probably have been corrected by him had he lived to do
it The judgment os the poem implied in this remark is one
³ vith which Ι could not agree if the quality os the later
ῑ books were concerned. But I rather take it to refer to a lew
· roughnesses⁸ os style here and there observable, and I am glad

tofind that this is the view os Teuffel.
