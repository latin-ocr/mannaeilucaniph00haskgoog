SCHEMES OF RE VENGE. THE CONSPIRA C y xxix

himself by the most approved methods, the career to which he
was devoted alike by his own bent and hythe traditions of his
family, was closed. It seemed that his only chance²⁸ lay in the
death os the emperor: and an opportunity soon offered os
taking part in a scheme which appeared to promise restoration
to public lise and the gratification os revenge.

(21) To write a narrative os the Pisonian conspiracy os AD 65
is not my purpose. It has been written once for all²⁹ by Tacitus.
lt seems to have had its beginnings as lar back as the year 62,
and the loyalty that kept secret so long a design of such mag·
nitude was the principal merit os the chief conspirators. Nero's
conduct had meanwhile become more than ever outrageous and
unbearable. In the year 64 came the great fire os Rome, and
suspicion pointing to the emperor: then the still more sus·
pieious cruelties against the Christians and other innocent
victims: and lastly the building os the Golden House. Early
in 65 the conspiracy took a definite sorm. Its leading incidents‚
—the weakness os its head Piso, the alleged complicity of
Seneca, the combination of a consul-elect and many leading
senators and knights with officers os the Imperial Guard‚ the
first abortive betrayal, the second successful one, the heroism os
the freedwoman Epicharis and the soldiers, the various the-
atrical or grovelling deaths os the rest, the alarm os Nero, the
number os innocent men and women on whom the conspiracy

*brought death or ruin,-all these are told by the author os the

Annals with his customary graphic vigour and telling contrasts
ol light and shade. The enterprisc was indeed as he sorewarns⁸⁰

of his Pharsalia, parts os which betray a spirit⁸¹ such as must
surely have possessed him now more than ever. He fed his
