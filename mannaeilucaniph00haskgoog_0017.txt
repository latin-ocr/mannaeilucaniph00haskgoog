viii TO THE READER.

A short experience of Weber is enough. Weise's preface is surely one
of the worst compositions that ever made pretence to judgment and
learning. Most os the remarks on Lucan in standard histories are
vague or misleading; and the sact is that if one is to form one’s
opinions on adequare grounds one must do the whole drudgery oneself.

This may have its compensatlng advantages. But it necessarily
increases the bulk of the work ; for, in order not to pretend to an
authority to which I can lay no claim, Ι leel compelled to print a large
mass of material in justification of opinions expressed. ln the case
ol two crucial questions, (r) who is the hero os the poem (2) what is
Lucan’s relation to Vergil, Ι have ventured into considerable detail,
but not Ι think without some result.

This kind oi work brings neither money nor repnte. To the very
sevv who will read these pages I look for an indulgent reception I have
hnd to work under great pressure of various duties and charges, and a
series oi interruptions tiresome but unavoidable. At the same time
there is pleasure in working at literature as literature: and the study
of even a second-rate author is not without its reward.

1 have omitted a great quantity of matteras irrelevant to my purpose,
and have passed over many remarks os Nisard and Genthe on this
ground. Some are omitted as having neither authority nor probability.
